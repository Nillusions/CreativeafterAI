You start with one decent idea, and suddenly, every variation feels like a photocopy. AI doesn't just hand you more options; it redraws the boundaries. Here's the honest truth:</p><p><em>AI is insanely good at volume. Humans are insanely good at taste. Great brainstorming happens when those two collide.</em></p><p>The best ideas don't come from asking politely. They come from forcing the algorithm into a corner, like demanding a meditation app logo that looks like a 1980s heavy metal album cover or a coffee manifesto written by a tired astronaut. That's when AI starts sweating and spits out the kind of ideas you'd never see coming.</p><h3>Idea expansion: Beyond the obvious</h3><p>You toss in a single seed. AI doesn't just spit back a list—it explodes it into:</p><ul><li>Angles you missed (because your brain's stuck in its usual grooves)</li><li>Metaphors that actually work (not the clichéd \"journey\" or \"puzzle piece\" nonsense)</li><li>Campaign hooks with teeth (the kind that makes clients lean in)</li><li>Taglines that don't sound like they were focus-grouped to death</li><li>Narratives with a pulse (stories, not corporate fairy tales)</li><li>Visual directions that aren't just \"make it pop\"</li></ul><p>But here's the hack most people skip: Force AI to think inside a box. Give it constraints—weird ones. \"Generate 10 taglines for a yoga brand, but make them sound like 1980s punk flyers.\" \"Design a logo for a bank, but it has to include a broken teacup.\" That's where the gold lives: not in the first 20 ideas, but the 21st, when the algorithm starts sweating.</p>",
        "techniques": "<ul><li><strong>Persona Role-Play</strong> — Instruct AI to adopt different expert mindsets—a skeptical CFO, frustrated customer, or optimistic venture capitalist—to uncover blind spots and pressure-test ideas from multiple angles. This helps you validate concepts before investing significant resources</li><li><strong>Reverse brainstorming</strong> — Forget the usual \"How do we make this work?\" question. Flip it: \"How could this spectacularly fail?\" AI isn't just here to cheerlead your ideas - it's your devil's advocate with a dataset . Need to pressure-test a campaign? Throw it a curveball: \"Give me 10 ways this could backfire in Delhi vs. Dubai.\" Launching a product? Ask: \"What's the worst-case scenario if our hashtag gets hijacked or our supply chain collapses?\" This isn't about killing ideas, it's about fortifying them . <br>AI doesn't just spot weaknesses; it invents them, throwing scenarios your team would never imagine. The result? You don't just build idea, you bulletproof them.</li><li><strong>The SCAMPER method</strong> — Forget staring at a blank page—real innovation often starts with what's already in front of you. The SCAMPER method (Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, Reverse) is your checklist for systematically flipping, twisting, and reinventing existing ideas. But here's the catch: humans hit mental fatigue after three prompts. AI doesn't. Feed it a product—a ceramic coffee mug, a fitness app, a checkout process—and it'll blast through all seven angles in seconds, serving up variations you'd never think to ask for. Need a mug that's also a phone charger? A workout app that adapts to your mood swings? A checkout flow that works backward? AI doesn't just suggest tweaks; it rewires the rules. Your move: Pick one idea, force it into a corner, and watch what breaks (in the best way).</li><li><strong>Data-Driven ideation</strong> — Data-driven ideation means listening before leaping. No more starting with hunches—you start with real human signals: • Messy survey answers, not just clean stats • Frustrated support chats, not just star ratings • Rants in comment sections, not just polished reviews • What people actually click, ignore, or abandon AI doesn't replace intuition; it sharpens it. It sifts through the noise to surface the raw tensions, unmet needs, and weird little gaps where the best ideas hide. The result? Work that feels bold and familiar—because it's built on what's already pulsing beneath the surface, not what someone thinks should matter. (No more betting on ideas that only sound good in brainstorms.)</li><li><strong>Killing weak ideas fast</strong> — AI becomes especially powerful once an idea already exists. Instead of only generating options, it can pressure-test concepts, expose clichés, and push thinking toward sharper, more daring directions. You can ask blunt questions like why an idea feels boring, how a brand like Apple might elevate it, or what would make it three times bolder. That kind of fast, honest critique turns AI into a creative sparring partner that saves time while raising the quality of the final work.</li><li><strong>Concept Blending</strong> — Combine 2-3 completely unrelated ideas to create novel business models or products. AI makes non-obvious connections without human biases, discovering unique market opportunities—like blending NFTs, community-supported agriculture, and escape rooms into a single concept.</li></ul><p><em>These techniques mainly support idea expansion. The real impact depends on the context you provide and how you use your intuition, taste, and experience to filter, remix, or reshape what AI generates.</em></p>",
        "prompts": "<p>While the prompts widely differ depending upon the use case and context of brainstorming, they generally fall under these categories -\n<br><strong>Open prompts and Directional prompts</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Aspect</th><th>Open Prompt</th><th>Directional Prompt</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Freedom level</strong></td><td>High</td><td>Medium to low</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Best for</strong></td><td>Creativity, brainstorming, exploration</td><td>Precision, consistency, specific framing</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Risk of off-topic</strong></td><td>Higher</td><td>Lower</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Typical output length</strong></td><td>Variable / often longer</td><td>More controlled</td></tr><tr><td><strong>When to choose</strong></td><td>Early ideation, open discussion</td><td>Final output, analysis, professional use</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Example technique</strong></td><td>Pure zero-shot open question</td><td>Role + format + focus + DSP cues</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Most power users mix both in the same conversation: Start with an open prompt to explore ideas broadly and follow up with directional refinement to shape, critique, expand, or format the best parts.</p><h3>Some sample prompts/ Prompt templates</h3><ul><li>Suggest me ways the idea of a \"Sneaker for when you are young\" will fail as a brand direction. Provide a list of 30 different and unique ways this will fail. Do not give me suggestion on improvement or solution. Also find real cases where similar brand with similar brand directions have utterly failed. Come up with follow up questions if you have doubts.</li><li>You are a senior creative director who specialises in unexpected, culturally sharp ideas. I'm working on: [describe the project — brand, campaign, product launch, content series] The audience is: [who they are, what they care about, what they usually see in this category] The brief in one line: [e.g. \"Make people feel excited about switching banks\"] Your job is NOT to give me safe ideas. Step 1 — Give me 15 completely different directional angles for this brief. For each one, give me: - The core idea in one sentence - The emotional territory it occupies (e.g. nostalgia, defiance, wonder) - A possible tagline (no corporate clichés) - A visual direction in 10 words or less Step 2 — Now force yourself into this constraint: [pick a weird one — e.g. \"every idea must reference something from the 1970s\" / \"every idea must feel like it was made by a street artist, not an agency\" / \"every idea must make the brand feel dangerous\"] Give me 5 more angles under that constraint. Step 3 — From all 20 ideas, flag the 3 you think are most unexpected and tell me why.</li><li>I'm about to [launch / pitch / publish / produce]: [describe the concept in detail] This is the audience: [describe them] This is the context: [platform, market, moment in culture, competitive landscape] Do NOT tell me what's working. I want to stress-test this hard. Round 1 — Kill it: - Give me 10 specific, realistic ways this could fail. Not generic risks — real ones. Include: messaging misfires, cultural blind spots, audience backlash, execution flaws, timing problems, competitive responses, and internal adoption issues. Round 2 — Pressure test it by geography and context: - How could this land differently in [Market A] vs [Market B]? - What happens if the hashtag / visual / spokesperson gets hijacked or mocked? - What does the worst-case press headline look like? Round 3 — Fortify it: - Based on everything above, give me 5 specific changes that would make this significantly more resilient without killing what makes it interesting. - Then give me the version that keeps 80% of the original boldness but addresses the 3 most critical risks you identified.</li><li>I want to apply the SCAMPER method to: [describe the product / campaign / concept / experience] Here's the full context: - What it currently is: [describe it] - Who it's for: [audience] - What problem it solves or emotion it delivers: [the core job it does] - What's boring or predictable about it right now: [be honest] Work through every SCAMPER lens. For each one, give me minimum 3 concrete ideas — not just observations, but actual executions I could act on. S — SUBSTITUTE: What element could be swapped for something from a completely different industry, era, or category? What if the medium was replaced entirely? C — COMBINE: What two things that have no business being together could be merged here? Think across categories, channels, or audiences. A — ADAPT: What exists in [adjacent industry or culture] that could be directly adapted here? What problem did someone else solve that we're ignoring? M — MODIFY / MAGNIFY / MINIFY: What if we made one element 10× bigger? What if we stripped it down to almost nothing? What would an exaggerated or a micro version look like? P — PUT TO ANOTHER USE: What entirely different audience or use case could this serve that we've never considered? E — ELIMINATE: What's the most sacred element of this idea? Now remove it. What's left? Is it better? R — REVERSE / REARRANGE: What if the process ran backwards? What if the audience became the creator? What if the problem was the product? After all seven: which 3 combinations across different letters produce the most surprising and viable new direction? Build those out in more detail.</li><li> need you to become [Persona Name]. Here is who [Persona Name] is: - Age and life situation: [e.g. 34, mid-level manager, two kids, time-poor] - Job / role: [e.g. Head of Procurement at a mid-size logistics company] - Personality: [e.g. deeply skeptical of marketing, values data over stories, has been burned by overpromising vendors before] - What they care most about: [e.g. ROI, team adoption, not looking foolish in front of their CFO] - Language they actually use: [e.g. they say \"does this scale\" and \"what's the proof point\" — they do not say \"innovative\" or \"game-changing\"] - Their biggest fear in this context: [e.g. recommending something that fails publicly] Stay in character completely. Do not break character to be helpful or encouraging. I am going to pitch you: [describe the product, service, or campaign] Your job: 1. Listen to the pitch 2. Ask the 5 hardest questions this person would actually ask 3. Push back on the 3 most vague or unsubstantiated claims 4. Tell me what's missing before you'd take this seriously 5. Tell me what single thing would make you lean in instead of lean out Pitch starts now: [your pitch]</li></ul><p><em>These are sample or template prompts, not perfect ones—because perfect prompts don't really exist. A prompt's real job is to give AI the right context, constraints, expectations, and examples for the specific task. Good prompts usually: Clarify the goal or outcome Provide relevant context Set boundaries like tone, format, or length Include useful examples or references Allow iteration and refinement In short, prompting isn't about perfection—it's about guiding the AI clearly to get useful results faster, then improving from there.</em></p>",
